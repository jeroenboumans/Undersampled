        And secondly, please allow me to introduce myself. I'm Jeroen Boumans (36), currently working as a system developer at <a href="https://hellosunshine.nl">Hello Sunshine</a> and <a href="https://stimuliz.com">Stimuliz</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2022 I decided to buy my first astrophotography gear: the <a href="http://skywatcher.com/product/star-adventurer/">Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer</a>; a star tracker.
        Taking this for a spin introduced me to the steep learning curve of astrophotography.
    <br>
        Back then, I shot my frames using an unmodified Canon 70D DSLR and a simple tripod without "GOTO"-features.
        Finding your targets with this kind of setup was a bit of a pain since the tracker was easily shifted away from the north celestial pole during alignment with your target.
        Also the amount of noise for DSLR's is inconsistent during your capturing since the outside temperature might change during a session. Shooting calibration frames should also happen during these temperatures.
    </p><p>
    Sooo....
        <br>After reading many reviews and blogs and watching many youtube video's I was determined to get into the hobby more seriously. This lead me to assembling a new setup and kickstart my journey from there.
