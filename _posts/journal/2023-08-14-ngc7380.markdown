## Description
The Wizard Nebula ðŸ§™, also catalogued as NGC 7000. I captured it in "only" 8h48m during not so great "seeing". 
This target is almost twice as dim (magnitude 7.2) than my previous image ([NGC 7000](/NGC7000), magnitude 4.0), 
but had to capture it quickly since we're dealing with dutch weather again. 
It is shot in Narrowband and ditched the greenish look for now. Might re-edit it in the future for a more Hubble'ish look.

The final image looks noisy so I might add more data in the future and/or create a revision.
Shooting targets like this with narrowband filters will create the posibility to create images with a more Hubble-like color palette than shooting broadband
(visual spectrum; what you see is what you get) images which result in a more red'ish looking image.

## Data Processing

Processing was done in PixInsight only. Steps of the process are listed below:

1. [ChannelCombination](https://pixinsight.com/doc/tools/ChannelCombination/ChannelCombination.html){:target="_blank"} (SHO),
2. [SPCC](https://pixinsight.com/doc/docs/SPCC/SPCC.html#__Applying_SPCC_to_Narrowband_Images__){:target="_blank"}, 
3. [ Color Calibration](https://pixinsight.com/doc/tools/ColorCalibration/ColorCalibration.html){:target="_blank"} for evening the SHO levels, 
4. DarkStructureEnhance, 
5. BlurXTerminator,
6. StarXTerminator (splitting stars and background), 
7. Masking and denoising applied to background layer using NoiseXTerminator, 
8. Boosting and adjusting colors and saturation, 
9. Recombining front and background using PixelMath, 
10. EZ Star Reduction, 
11. Final tweaks...
