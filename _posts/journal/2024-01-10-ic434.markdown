## Description

This is 🐴 IC434 🐴 mostly known by its other name: the **Horsehead Nebula**.

Ever seen those three almost perfectly aligned stars in the night sky during winter? The lowest star (seen from the northern hemisphere) is surrounded by a massive hydrogen cloud where stars can be formed and has a diameter of 1500 light years.

Shot this image using a Hydrogen-alpha (Hα) filter and regular red, green and blue filters.

> ## Merging H-alpha with RGB data
> This image needed a different approach. Since IC434 contains lots of Hydrogen, I shot with a Hydrogen filter rather than a Lumminance filter. This way I could filter out the
> details of the nebulae. After combining **red**, **green** and **blue** channel data, normally, you'd merge it with **luminance** data. Instead, I merged the **hydrogen** data with the **red** channel using PixelMath. For this, the following statement was provided on the red channel:
>
> ```
> # PixelMath
> B: $T
> G: $T
> R: $T * 0.05 + Hα * 0.95
> ```

Below you can see the H-alpha master file I used

## H-alpha Inverted

For most of the narrowband images I create an inverted image as well. This way details are more visible than normal. Below is the inverted Hα-master.

## Data Processing

Processing was done in PixInsight only. Steps of the process are listed below:

1. DynamicBackgroundExtraction on separate channels,
2. LRGBCombination on only RGB channels
3. [SPCC](https://pixinsight.com/doc/docs/SPCC/SPCC.html#__Applying_SPCC_to_Narrowband_Images__){:target="_blank"},
4. Merging Ha with Red channel on RGB image using expression: **$T * 0.05 + Ha * 0.95**
5. Rerunning [SPCC](https://pixinsight.com/doc/docs/SPCC/SPCC.html#__Applying_SPCC_to_Narrowband_Images__){:target="_blank"} again for exact spectral match of stars and therefor enhancing red channel,
6. [BlurXTerminator](https://www.rc-astro.com/software/bxt/){:target="_blank"} on the HaRGB-channel for correcting stars and nebulae
7. [SNCR](https://www.pixinsight.com/doc/legacy/LE/21_noise_reduction/scnr/scnr.html){:target="_blank"} noise reduction (0,70) to reduce green noise,
8. BackgroundNeutralization to make sure background is correctly calibrated
9. Stretched the image using HistogramTransformation
10. DarkStructureEnhance on the image (0,40) to enhance horsehead nebula
11. [StarXTerminator](https://www.rc-astro.com/software/sxt/){:target="_blank"} (splitting stars and background),
12. Adjustments with [CurvesTransformation](https://pixinsight.com/doc/tools/CurvesTransformation/CurvesTransformation.html){:target="_blank"}
13. [NoiseXTerminator](https://www.rc-astro.com/software/nxt/){:target="_blank"} on the starless image using masks for separate background and galaxy noise reduction
14. Merging of the stars and starless image using PixelMath, expression: **$T + HaRGB_stars**
15. Final adjustments with [CurvesTransformation](https://pixinsight.com/doc/tools/CurvesTransformation/CurvesTransformation.html){:target="_blank"} 
16. [BlurXTerminator](https://www.rc-astro.com/software/bxt/){:target="_blank"} for reducing star size a bit
