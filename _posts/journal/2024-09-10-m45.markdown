## Description
You might think you recognize this image. And you're absolutely right!

I've posted an image with the same object, the Pleiades (M45), back in September 2022 on Instagram, just when I started my astrophotography journey.
Since we're dealing with rain again and the Pleiades season is upcoming, I decided to put my new Pixinsight workflow to the test on this older dataset.

## Astrometry Calibration

|--------------|--------------------|
| RA center    | 03h47m01s.2        |
| DEC Center   | +24°07′04″         |
| Pixel Scale  | 1.561 arcsec/pixel |
| Orientation  | 311.827 degrees    |
| Field radius | 1.830 degrees      |

## Data Processing

Processing was done in PixInsight only. Steps of the process are listed below:

1. Weighted Batch PreProcessing,
2. DynamicBackgroundExtraction,
3. ImageSolver,
4. SpectrometricColorCalibration,
5. BlurXTerminator,
6. HistogramTransformation,
7. ChannelCombination for merging a SYnthethic Luminance with RGB data,
8. StarXterminator,
9. CurvesTransformation on the background image
10. NoiseXTerminator on the image. `0.8:0.23` (Denoise:Detail) applied to the background and `0.64:0.30` to the reflection nebulae using masks.
11. PixelMath for merging the starless image with the stars.

## Final Result

Please check the image in full resolution on my [Astrobin](https://www.astrobin.com/bd8nni/) post.
