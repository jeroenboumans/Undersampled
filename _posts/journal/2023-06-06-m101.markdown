## Description
This is Messier 101, also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy. After the [discovery](https://science.nasa.gov/supernova-discovered-nearby-spiral-galaxy-m101)
of a recent supernova, **SN 2023ixf**, I decided to give this target a try with my wide angle RedCat 51.

Could use a larger focal length but pretty content with this one as the skies are getting shorter and less dark these days, 
resulting in less available exposure time. Also frames were shot during full moon causing some colored background gradients and loss of signal.

The image below shows a high contrast visual of the annotated M101 and its supernova.

## Data Processing

Processing was done in PixInsight only. Steps of the process are listed below:

1. Weighted Batch PreProcessing,
2. DynamicBackgroundExtraction
3. [ChannelCombination](https://pixinsight.com/doc/tools/ChannelCombination/ChannelCombination.html){:target="_blank"}, 
4. HistogramTransformation
5. Masked appliance of NoiseXTerminator and CurvesTransformation
6. Final adjustments in Photoshop.
