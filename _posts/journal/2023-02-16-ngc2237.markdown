## Description
Roses are red and violets are blue, this rose-like nebula's glowing a very red hue; Rosette Nebula (also known as Caldwell 49). 
Shot it without an Hα-filter so it took me some more hours of integration. 
Wasn't the warmest type of weather but I'm glad we're having clear skies again! 

Shot this one is for my girl and our 11 years together.

## Data Processing

Processing was done in PixInsight only. Steps of the process are listed below:

1. Weighted Batch PreProcessing,
2. DynamicBackgroundExtraction, 
3. MultiscaleLinearTransform (using star masks),
4[ChannelCombination](https://pixinsight.com/doc/tools/ChannelCombination/ChannelCombination.html){:target="_blank"} (RGB),
5. ImageSolver,
6. PhotometricColorCalibration,
7. BlurXTerminator,
8. HistogramTransformation
9. RGB + Luminance merging and curves adjustments were done in Photoshop. No color adjustments applied, only vibrance and saturation.
