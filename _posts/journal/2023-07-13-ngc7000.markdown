## Description
The North America Nebula, also âœ¨ NGC 7000 âœ¨.
I captured it about a year ago using my Canon 70D DSLR but decided to finally pull the trigger and get some narrowband filters for my ASI533mm Pro.

Shooting targets like this with narrowband filters will create the posibility to create images with a more Hubble-like color palette than shooting broadband
(visual spectrum; what you see is what you get) images which result in a more red'ish looking image.

ðŸ”­ Hope you guys like it. Clear skies!

> If you'd like to create a narrowband image and want to follow the Hubble palette, you'd assign narrowband as **SHO** instead of **HOO**/**HSO**.

## Data Processing

Processing was done in PixInsight only. Steps of the process are listed below:

1. [ChannelCombination](https://pixinsight.com/doc/tools/ChannelCombination/ChannelCombination.html){:target="_blank"} (SHO),
2. BlurXTerminator,
3. [SPCC](https://pixinsight.com/doc/docs/SPCC/SPCC.html#__Applying_SPCC_to_Narrowband_Images__){:target="_blank"}, 
4. [ Color Calibration](https://pixinsight.com/doc/tools/ColorCalibration/ColorCalibration.html){:target="_blank"} for evening the SHO levels, 
5. DarkStructureEnhance, 
6. StarXTerminator (splitting stars and background), 
7. Masking and denoising applied to background layer using NoiseXTerminator, 
8. Boosting and adjusting colors and saturation, 
9. Recombining front and background using PixelMath, 
10. EZ Star Reduction, 
11. Final tweaks...
