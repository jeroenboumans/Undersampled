## Description
I present to you, the heart of the Heart Nebula: Melotte 15 ❤️. After weeks of cloudy skies, 
I finally had four clear nights to collect data for this image! This deep exposure combines narrowband 
data (SHO) with broadband (RGB) star data. The final integration time adds up to 17h 20m, making this my longest project in a while!

Processing was done in PixInsight, focusing on balancing the faint structures while keeping a natural starfield. 
The RGB stars were captured separately on the last night to prevent stars from becoming purple in the calibration process.
## Astrometry Calibration

|--------------|--------------------|
| RA center    | 02h33m22s.8        |
| DEC Center   | +61°20′38″         |
| Pixel Scale  | 1.584 arcsec/pixel |
| Orientation  | 338.738 degrees    |
| Field radius | 0.885 degrees      |

## Data Processing

Processing was done in PixInsight only. Steps of the process are listed below:

1. SpectrophotometricFluxCalibration,
2. DynamicBackgroundExtraction,
3. BlurXTerminator,
5. SpectrophotometricColorCalibration,
6. ColorCalibration on Melotte 15 to match the RGB channels levels,
7. ChannelCombination for merging a SYnthethic Luminance with RGB data,
8. MaskedStretch for stretching and keeping the bright parts of the nebula under control,
9. StarXTerminator for removing stars from the SHO data,
10. Final stretch with HistogramTransformation,
9. Creation of a so called 'synthetic luminance' by combining the SHO data with SNR as the weighting factor. The synthetic luminance was
then combined as the CIELab L channel on the SHO data.
10. NoiseXTerminator on the image using denoise: **1.00:0.91** (color:luminance), low frequency denoise: **1.00:0.80** (color:luminance), frequency scale: **6.6**, and **5** iterations.
11. Used [NarrowbandNormalization](https://www.cosmicphotons.com/pi-modules/narrowbandnormalization/) to balance the SHO data.
12. Color correction with CurvesTransformation on the background image
13. Sharpening with UnsharpMask on the background image
14. Noise reduction with NoiseXTerminator on the background image
15. Adding the RGB stars on top of the SHO data with PixelMath to prevent purple stars.
16. FastRotation for better angle :)
17. ImageSolver for adding the astrometry data to the image.
