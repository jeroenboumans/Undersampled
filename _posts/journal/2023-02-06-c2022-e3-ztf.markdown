## Description
As you might have seen "elsewhere" ... this is ☄️ **C/2022 E3 (ZTF)** 

This is my first comet since I started astrophotography this year, which is a bit more difficult to process since it's a moving target and therefor needed a different approach.
Its closest approach was on feb 1st but took some shots earlier that week on jan 28th since we're dealing with a lot of dutch weather here and I didn't want to miss out; 
next opportunity is somewhere within the next **50.000** years(!).

> ## Horizontal banding
> **Note (added on 27 jul '23):** As can be seen on the images there is some horizontal banding visible. It seems that the flat frames were causing this due to the short exposure times.
> Because of this stretching was possible only very limited. One way to prevent this is making sure you're exposing a couple of seconds per calibration frame instead. You can add another layer of "t-shirt" or
> capture your flat frames using a backlit panel, a tablet or during dusk.
